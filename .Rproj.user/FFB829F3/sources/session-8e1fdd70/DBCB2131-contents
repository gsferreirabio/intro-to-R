Welcome to the website of the **Introduction to R** course (Geow-M317_325-21-16). 
This short course is part of the *Data Analysis and Modeling Methods in Geoscience and Environmental Science* module of the [Geosciences Department](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/geowissenschaften/fachbereich/) (Uni. Tübingen) and is developed and taught by [Gabriel Ferreira](https://www.gabrielsferreira.com).

The *Intro to R* course aims to provide a brief introduction to using the R programming language and environment in a data science context, particularly for students in the areas of Geology and Palaeontology. With a lot of hands-on exercises, the students are expected to feel comfortable to use and explore the many possibilities provided by R. 

You can use the sidebar to navigate through the different code presented in each day of the course.

We will use the RStudio integrated development environment (IDE) for R during this course. You can either install on your own machine or create a free account to use the cloud version of it (but keep in mind that the computing power and hours are limited with the free account, so this might not be enough — particularly in the last days of the course). Make sure to update R (<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>) and RStudio (<https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>) as this page will be kept up-to-date using the latest version.
